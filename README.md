## About

`p4` is a perfect solver for board game "Connect Four" written in Rust, which is ported of the great [connect4](https://github.com/PascalPons/connect4) solver written in C++.
Thank you [Pasal Pons](https://github.com/PascalPons)!

The solver uses [iterative deepening depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_depth-first_search) with
[alpha-beta prunning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning). Details are explained by [Pascal Pons's articles](http://blog.gamesolver.org).
